    //We need a function that can print cards, we name it print

	//The function we use for the mixing property is called shuffle

	//To select a set of cards, we use the deal function

    //We select a variable of type string and assign a value to it
	//The name of this variable is card

	//cards :="Ace of spades"
	//colon equal

	// to a variable because we have 52 cards

	//In line 6, we change the variable from one mode to
