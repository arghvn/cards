In the structures, when we gave the desired changes to GO, a copy of the structure was created inside GO.
Therefore, when we change that function, we change the copy and not the original structure.

the difference between slice and array in GO :

slice can grow annd shrink 
slice used 99% of the time for lists of elements 

arrays primitive data structure cant be resized
arrays rarly used directly

GO is directly access to slice and array
