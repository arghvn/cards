Send HTTP requests with Postman
With the core concepts out of our way, let’s use Postman for sending a basic GET request.

Send a GET request with Postman
Typically, we use GET requests for retrieving data from an API. Follow the below steps to make your first
request in Postman.
1. Add a new request by hovering your mouse over your collection of choice (if you don’t have any, please
create one now), click on the little ... icon, and then click on the Add request link.
2. Pick a name that suits your request best.
3. Since the GET method is selected by default, you don’t need to select the method.
4. Use the URL field to set the endpoint URL
5. Click on the Send button. Postman sends the request to the provided endpoint and shows the result.
Send a POST request with Postman
Unlike GET requests, POST requests can contain a request body. Postman allows you to include data of
different formats in the request body.
